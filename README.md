# Rocket-Simulation
This is a small program to apply what was learned in a basic C++ course.

Simulation of the launch and movement of a rocket in the console. After the user enters the command 'start,' the engines are ignited, the rocket status is displayed, and the movement is simulated over 100 steps in real time with regular console updates. The position is calculated based on a fixed time interval. Additionally, text files are used to graphically represent animations and the movement of the rocket.
